Captures content using DOM analysis (headings, code blocks, paragraphs, lists)
Takes screenshots of visited pages
Special handling for YouTube videos (extracts transcripts)
Generates concise markdown notes using AI (supports both OpenAI/GPT-4 and Anthropic/Claude APIs)
Allows reviewing and exporting the generated notes
Folder Structure
background/: Contains the service worker (background.js) that manages extension state, API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic, and screenshot functionality

Workflow
User clicks "Start Recording" in the popup
As they browse documentation, the extension captures content from each page
A sidebar shows captured websites with the option to remove specific pages
When finished, user clicks "Stop & Generate"
The extension uses AI (GPT-4 or Claude) to generate markdown notes from the collected content
User can review and export the notes as a markdown file
The extension requires an API key for either OpenAI or Anthropic, which users configure in the settings page.
